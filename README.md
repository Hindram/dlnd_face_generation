## Face Generation
In this project, we have defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. Our goal was to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

The project has been broken down into a series of tasks from loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks. At the end of the notebook, we was able to visualize the results of the trained Generator to see how it performs.
